        <FAQItem title="What is Chakra?">
          Chakra Network is a high-performance middleware chain designed as a cross-chain settlement layer for major
          blockchains. Our mission is to securely bridge and efficiently settle native BTC and BTC-derived assets (e.g.,
          Wrapped BTC and ERC-20 LST/LRTs) across diverse ecosystems, unlocking new opportunities in yield-generating
          scenarios.

        <FAQItem title="Can I stake Bitcoin on Babylon through Chakra?">
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-3 sm:gap-4">
            <div>
              Currently, Chakra has paused its Bitcoin Staking Pool for Babylon as we undergo rebranding and prepare to
              launch our new settlement services, cross-chain mining feature, and upcoming Vault product. However,
              Chakra continues to serve as a top Finality Provider for Babylon Bitcoin Staking, securing over $122.05M
              TVL. You can still stake Bitcoin directly on Babylon and select Chakra as your Finality Provider for
              enhanced security and trust.
            </div>
            <div>
              For funds already in the Chakra Bitcoin Staking Pool, users have two options: withdraw, or keep them with
              Chakra for automatic transfer to the upcoming Vault product within the Chakra ecosystem, where you can
              unlock additional yield opportunities.

          <div className="flex flex-col gap-3 sm:gap-4">
            <div>
              BTC withdrawals will be processed on the BNB Chain, and users will only need to cover the BNB transaction
              costs, which are less than 0.00007 BNB per transaction.
            </div>
            <div>
              To minimize expenses for our users, Chakra has waived all administration fees. We remain committed to
              providing a cost-effective and user-friendly experience.

        <FAQItem title="If I keep my staked BTC with Chakra, what will be the return?">
          Your returns will come from multiple yield streams: you will earn Babylon Points, allocated proportionally
          based on Babylon's Point System, and Chakra Pranas, where every 0.0001 BTC staked earns you 1 Prana daily,
          refreshed via snapshots in the Chakra Staking dApp. Additionally, with the launch of the Vault product, your
          staked BTC will participate in cross-chain mining, unlocking more layers of yield across EVM and non-EVM
          ecosystems. For more details on Babylon Points, visit:{" "}

          <div className="flex flex-col gap-3 sm:gap-4">
            <div>
              Prana is a reward point system for users staking Bitcoin on Chakra, serving as both an early participation
              credential and a key incentive within the Chakra ecosystem. While the exchange details for Prana have not
              yet been announced, it may have additional use cases or reward formats in the future.
            </div>
            <div>
              We will continue to enhance Prana's value based on ecosystem growth and community feedback. Keep
              participating in our campaigns to earn more Pranaâ€”exciting opportunities await!

              Looking ahead, we plan to launch the Vault product in our ecosystem to unlock cross-chain mining and

              strategic collaboration with Babylon to drive broader adoption and integration.
